=== Introduction
The OCloud framework helps operators to build enterprise cloud services on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). While launching a server in a public cloud has become a matter of pressing a button, building a hosting platform for intra- and extranet services is more challenging. This framework aims at system administrators building enterprise services. link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code["Infrastructure as Code" (IaC)] is employed to address advanced compliance and security requirements with agility, utilizing automation scipts that provision dedicated infrastructure and deploy operator controls together with a service. The framework helps operators to launch a new service while they still evaluate the numerous configuration options. It provides a baseline configuration with parameters that are separated from the deployment code and avoids prescribing bespoke topologies. With the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm[Oracle's Resource Manager (ORM)] operators can rely on state-aware provisioning and adjust topologies when requirements evolve. For one-time deployments, the link:https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-devrel/terraform-oci-ocloud-landing-zone/archive/refs/heads/main.zip[Deploy to the Oracle Cloud] button creates a zip archive that is pushed to the resource manager directly, to enable continuous changes the code should be cloned into a private repository and be connected as a source provider.

=== Getting Started
With an OCI tenancy operators gain access to a scalable infrastructure pool. A service resident isolates a private partition and implements the policies for a new team of service operators. Using link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm[compartments] operators separate the application space from shared domains like network and database management.

Compartments reflect administrator domains in OCI and enable the separation of duties. The domain component adds a typical set of infrastructure resources, policies, guidelines and management services to each compartment. Domains can be customized in the link:https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/modules/syntax.html[module block] of the respective administrator template.

==== Service Assets
Platform components abstract provider specific APIs and contain code that can refer to multiple resource provider in order to merge resources from multiple provider into logical, customer specific resource interfaces. The resources manager comes with a number of link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/providers.htm[service provider] preinstalled, additional can be pulled form the link:https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers[Terraform registry], using the link:https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/providers/configuration.html[provider block]. Components reflect best practices, collected throughout numerous projects and remain subject to change. Initially we provide the following modules:

* link:assets/resident[Resident] is the compartment block combined with groups and policies that define a working environment for cloud and security operators
* link:assets/network[Network] defines the compartment and role for network administrators together with a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) incl. Dynamic Routing Gateway and gateways for NAT, Internet and Oracle Services

Additional modules can be invoked referring to OCI modules in the link:https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=oci[terraform registry], a great starting point with limited coding requirements are the link:https://registry.terraform.io/search/modules?q=oci%20cloud%20bricks[cloudbricks] components.  

==== Resource Interfaces

Modules deploy a variety of different resources, like infrastructure components, predefined cloud services, applications or third party software products. Usually we employ the terraform service provider to provision resources, however, command line scripts, API or SDK are additional options.

==== Prerequisites
Code is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), includes data stored in JSON format and cloud init scripts. We use the OCI Resource Manager service to install, configure, and manage Terraform code in order to support a fast adoption of the "infrastructure-as-code" model.

The landing zone is meant to provision resources in an isolated compartment. The naming should be unique though, because some resources, like tag namepaces and policy groups are defined on root level. While compartment names are constructed to avoid overlaps, name conflicts are avoided referring to a tenancy specific link:doc/naming.adoc[naming convention].

=== Notes/Issues
* It is recommended to run the first "terraform apply" without bastion session enabled. Enabling the bastion session in the first run will produce an error message. Run the "apply" a second time resolves the issue. 
* The resource manager is using some terms internally, these need to be avoided defining a stack. examples are "user" or "domain".
* Destroying compartments and tag namespaces should be an exception and can take a long time. Best practice is destroying all other resources using a reduce apply scope, before destroying the compartments with a destroy command. In the default setup, the "enable_delete" flag prevents un-intensional destroy of compartments. 
* The stack deploys multiple tag namespaces that can only be destroyed one by one. Hence, running destroy for the first and second time will fail and the process has to be repeated at least twice.
