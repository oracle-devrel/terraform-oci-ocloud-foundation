== Database Infrastructure: Virtual Machine Database Systems
(Source: [OCI documentation] (https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/overview.htm))

Oracle Infrastructure Cloud offers installation of DB system on Bare Metal, VM and Exadata which includes the hardware, storage software, and networking configuration required to run Oracle Databases in the Oracle cloud.

The following usecase describes how to launch an DB System on VM through an Oracle Resource Management stack.

=== Database as a Service on VM Stack

![Database System](image/database_sys_vm.png "Database System Diagram")

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides single-node DB systems on virtual machines, and 2-node RAC DB systems on virtual machines. If you need to provision a DB system for development or testing purposes, a special  fast-provisioning single-node virtual machine system is available.

You can manage these systems by using the Console, the API, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI, the Database CLI (DBCLI), Enterprise Manager, or SQL Developer.

==== Supported Database Editions and Versions

All single-node Oracle RAC DB systems support the following Oracle Database editions:

- Standard Edition
- Enterprise Edition
- Enterprise Edition - High Performance
- Enterprise Edition - Extreme Performance
- Two-node Oracle RAC DB systems require Oracle Enterprise Edition - Extreme Performance.

For standard provisioning of DB systems (using Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM) as your storage management software), the supported database versions are:

- Oracle Database 21c
- Oracle Database 19c
- Oracle Database 18c (18.0)
- Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2)
- Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1)
- Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2)

For fast provisioning of single-node virtual machine database systems (using Logical Volume Manager as your storage management software), the supported database versions are:

- Oracle Database 21c
- Oracle Database 19c
- Oracle Database 18c
- Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2)

=== Workload Types

Database as a Service on VM supports the following Workload Types:

**DW**: Built for decision support and data warehouse workloads. Offers fast queries over large volumes of data.

**OLTP**: Built for transactional workloads. Offers high concurrency for short-running queries and transactions.

=== Prerequistes

In order to use a customized database image create a database sotware image in your database compartment

1. In OCI console go to **Bare Matel, VM and Exadata** -> **Database Software Image**
1. Select **Create Database Software Image**

For automated backups validate that the Database subnet has access to object storage

=== Default Installation

DBaaS on VM ORM Stack includes three standard installation scenarios and a custom mode: 
- Small: 19c Oracle Enterprise Edition Database System, 2 OCPUs and 512 GB of Storage
- Medium: 19c Oracle Enterprise Edition Database System, 8 OCPUs and 4 TB of of Storage
- Large: 19c Oracle Enterprise Edition Database System, 16 OCPUs and 8 TB of of Storage

**Note:** Deployment Type Cluster demands Oracle Enterprise Extreem Performance Edition.

 It is expected that a <service label>-database-cmp, private <service label>-0-db-subnet and <service label>-0-vcn-db-nsg had been created as part of the CIS Landing Zone stack. Pick a different network and database compartment if desired however this might require you to create additional network resources.

In addition to setting the size of the instances to small, medium or large, Deployment Type allows to perform a fast provisioned instance, a basic instance or a cluster:

- Fast Provisioning
    - Storage Management Software: LVM
    - Auto Backup enabled: false
    - Node Count: 1
- Basic
    - Storage Management Software: ASM
    - Auto Backup enabled: true
    - Node Count: 1
- Cluster
    - Storage Management Software: ASM
    - Auto Backup enabled: true
    - Node Count: 2

**Note:** For a quick deployment make sure that LVM is used as Storage Management Software. Where a LVM based deployment takes around 20 minutes, a ASM based installation will take about an hour.

1. Navigate to OCI Resource Manager
1. Create a Stack
1. Load dbaas.zip
1. Enter mandetory parameters
    1. **Service Label:** Make sure that the service label matches with the information given for CIS Landing Zone.
    1. **DB System Name:** User provided non-unique database system name
    1. **Container Database Name:**  It must begin with an alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of eight alphanumeric characters. Special characters are not permitted. The unique database name is the DB name plus a random string. Accept the default if you don't have any other preferences.
    1. **User-provided name of Database Home:** Accept the default if you don't have any other preferences
    1. **Pluggable Database Name:** The name must begin with an alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of thirty alphanumeric characters. Special characters are not permitted. Pluggable database should not be same as database name
    1. **DBaaS on VM Standard Configurations:** Select Small, Medium or Large configuration

**Node Count:**

The number of nodes to launch for a 2-node RAC virtual machine DB system. Specify either 1 or 2.

**Cluster Name:** 

The cluster name 2-node RAC virtual machine DB systems. The cluster name must begin with an alphabetic character, and may contain hyphens (-). Underscores (_) are not permitted. The cluster name can be no longer than 11 characters and is not case sensitive.
If Node Count is 2 and Cluster Name is not given set it defaults to <service>-rac.

**Oracle Database Software Edition:**

The Oracle Database edition that applies to all the databases on the DB system. Supported values are:

- Standard Edition
- Enterprise Edition
- Enterprise Edition - High Performance
- Enterprise Edition - Extreme Performance

Note: The database edition depends on the database system configuration, i.e. a 2-node RAC deployment demands "Enterprise Edition - Extreme Performance".

**Storage Management Software:**

The storage option used in DB system. ASM - Automatic storage management, LVM - Logical Volume management. Where ASM is default, fast provisioning only can be done with LVM.

**License Type:**

The Oracle license model that applies to all the databases on the DB system. Options are "Bring Your Own License (BYOL)" or License included (LICENSE_INCLUDED). The default is LICENSE_INCLUDED.

**Network Compartment:**

By default this DB Stack expects all network related resources (VCN, subnet, NSG) to exist in a network compartment, <service label>-network-cmp.  

**Database System VCN:** 

Database System VCN, <service label>-0-vcn.

**Database System Subnet:**

**Hostname Prefix:**

The hostname prefix for the DB system nodes.

**Fault Domain:**

A Fault Domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Fault Domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or maintenance that affects one Fault Domain does not affect DB systems in other Fault Domains.

If you do not specify a Fault Domain, Oracle will automatically pick one for you. For a 2-node DBSystem the second node is automatically placed in a different Fault-Domain.

**Timezone:**

The time zone to use for the DB system. In Resource Manager you can select from UTC or Europe/Berlin. Default is UTC.
 
**CDB Name:**

The Container Database name must begin with an alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of eight alphanumeric characters. Special characters are not permitted.

**Pluggable DB Name:**

The name of the pluggable database. The name must begin with an alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of thirty alphanumeric characters. Special characters are not permitted. Pluggable database should not be same as database name.

**Workload Type:**

The database workload type which either can be OLTP or DW.

**Automatic Backups:**

If set to true, configures automatic backups. If you previously used RMAN or dbcli to configure backups and then you switch to using the Console or the API for backups, a new backup configuration is created and associated with your database. This means that you can no longer rely on your previously configured unmanaged backups to work.

Related parameters for this option are:

- Backup Window:

Time window selected for initiating automatic backup for the database system. There are twelve available two-hour time windows. If no option is selected, a start time between 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the region of the database is automatically chosen. For example, if the user selects SLOT_TWO from the enum list, the automatic backup job will start in between 2:00 AM (inclusive) to 4:00 AM (exclusive). Example: SLOT_TWO

- Backup Retention Period:

Number of days between the current and the earliest point of recoverability covered by automatic backups. This value applies to automatic backups only. After a new automatic backup has been created, Oracle removes old automatic backups that are created before the window. When the value is updated, it is applied to all existing automatic backups.
 
**Character Set:**

The character set for the database. The default is AL32UTF8

**National Character Set:**

The national character set for the database. The default is AL16UTF16.

=== Output

1. all_connection_strings
